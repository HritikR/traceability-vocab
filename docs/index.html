      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification is designed to enable global supply chain stakeholders to leverage the benefits of emerging
        technological web standards, specifically Linked Data (JSON-LD), the Verifiable Credential (VC) Data Model, and the
        Decentralized Identifier (DID) Spec. It addresses prevalent supply chain, and allows for other provenance, use cases across a variety of market
        segments. The corresponding data exchange schemas are modeled for Verifiable Credentials, which is a standard for
        cryptographically signing business data. Schema semantics are precisely defined by use of Linked Data, leveraging
        established vocabularies such as schema.org, GS1, and UN/CEFACT, enabling interoperability and digitization.
      </p>

      <h3>Supply Chain Digitization Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        While digitization has revolutionized other industries with decades worth of value already created, supply chains at
        large have been slow and fragmented in their digital transformation journey, having yet to reap the full benefits. The
        sheer number and heterogeneity of involved actors makes technological advances incredibly difficult; physical paper,
        manual processing, and outdated technologies still support the vast majority of all supply chain information flows.
        Paper processing costs the supply-chain industry upwards of $3 billion every year (not counting the additional costs of
        paper, ink, and printing)
        (see "<a href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/32802-paper-the-bane-of-the-supply-chain-and-how-to-combat-it">When Will Supply Chains Finally Move on From Paper?</a>").
        The resulting data silos and blind spots throughout the supply chain have created an
        enormous problem that enterprises and regulators can no longer ignore &mdash; in a space where the inherent global nature of
        supply chains is itself a coordination obstacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic standards and code lists are being rigorously managed by various standards organizations. However, as long as
        these publications depend on manual adoption and/or complex implementation, the actual impacts of these investments are
        limited and delayed. Language barriers and differing contexts is a major source of imprecision and errors. Even
        today, most enterprises have only 20% visibility into their supply chains, as opposed to the 70% to 90% percent
        needed to monitor these investments
        (see "<a href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/31062-in-2020-supply-chain-digitization-is-no-longer-optional">In 2020, Supply-Chain Digitization Is No Longer Optional</a>").
        The identity of supply chain actors is a separate problem resulting in costs and
        errors. While nations and platforms have established digital identity regimes within their relevant boundaries, no
        useful global identity scheme has emerged, never mind been adopted. Public policy, borders, and commercial obstacles
        create large barriers for a global centralized model to be adopted. The result of this is that most businesses need to
        invest heavily in IT infrastructure and middleware data mapping tools to be integrated with their trading partners. In
        fact, digitizing a major supply chain will cost tens of millions of dollars at the current pace and be a three to five
        year transformation effort (see "<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/a-simpler-way-to-modernize-your-supply-chain">A Simpler Way to Modernize Your Supply Chain</a>"). This means a heavy
        investment of capital, resulting in de-facto vendor software lock-in.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology Enablement</h2>
      <h3>Establishing Trust</h3>
      <p>
        Trust is fundamental to trade. As global citizens, we rely on efficient supply chains, and the supply chains
        themselves are actually a network of collaborative stakeholders who are economically reliant on one another &mdash; from
        shippers and carriers to importers to regulators. Traditionally, trust is established by analogue signed contracts,
        physical meetings, phone calls, faxes, and regular audits that prove credibility of the engaging parties and
        compliance with relevant regulation. Digitization efforts in the “contractual trust” sphere have been limited by the
        fact that altering digital data &mdash; like PDFs &mdash; is incredibly easy to do and difficult to detect. Noteworthy steps taken
        to address this are encrypted communication channels like HTTPS and commercial digital signature platforms. However, a
        trusted channel does not prevent data alteration by either party, and globally scaling a fully proprietary platform is
        inherently expensive with political, and practical implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This landscape has changed with the advent of the Verifiable Credentials standard, which makes digital contractual
        trust accessible and affordable to use for anyone on the planet. Essentially, Verifiable Credentials apply existing
        cryptographic standards (particularly modern curve-based digital signature algorithms) to business data that is
        typically exchanged over APIs or XML. The Verifiable Credentials specification provides a data model for how data
        along with a cryptographic signature should be represented in a data file. The data itself can be anything -
        describing a shipment, an organization, a product, an agreement, etc. The cryptographic element ensures that anyone
        being presented the data file can verify that the data is how the issuer intended it to be. In other words, the use of
        cryptographic standards provides the verifier a sense of trust when presented the data file from the issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implications of this to global supply chains are immense. The analogue equivalent of contractual binding by
        applying a signature is obvious; and it should be noted that a cryptographic signature is much safer from a security
        point of view.
        <br />
        The possibilities go much further. Trust can be established remotely and fully automated, provided suitable claims are
        presented and issued by a trustworthy third party, such as an existing business partner, a commercial agent, or
        government. "Chains of trust" can be established by linking back through relevant claims to a known trust anchor.
      </p>

      <h3>Linked Semantics</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the supply chain, organizations use different words to say the same thing. For example, “Shipper” and
        “Consignor” are used interchangeably in shipping. A lot of effort goes into ensuring precise communication
        across supply chain participants with these varying vocabularies. Standards bodies govern semantic models with term
        definitions, APIs for common use cases, and code lists in an attempt to avoid ambiguity. The traditional challenge of
        such technical publications has been the human element: reading the spec, interpreting the API attribute name, or
        skimming through the code list, the data sender and data receiver has to establish the same understanding. This
        results in effort and IT costs from both the sender and receiver to ensure this common understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data addresses this problem by letting computers establish the semantic meaning. Leveraging how the web works,
        Linked Data explicitly points every term used to a precise Unique Resource Identifier (URI). Much like a URL pointing
        at a specific website, a URI defines a specific term. Thus, when the data sender defines a term by pointing at a URI,
        there is no interpretation to be done as the receiving computer can automatically understand it. Beyond the obvious
        benefit of establishing shared understanding, integrating Linked Data is simpler, avoiding the cost and complexity of
        data interpretation and mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data is not new, it is what drives internet indexing and search engines. This traceability-vocab specification
        introduces this technology for use in the supply chain industry. Sometimes this approach is referred to as "Web 3.0."
        All the schemas which define the data content of Verifiable Credentials are constructed with explicit pointers to the
        most relevant URIs of the terms used. Existing term definitions, which are available in online vocabularies, can be
        used to construct the Verifiable Credential schemas.
      </p>

      <h3>Global Identification Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        A final important part of modernizing the digital supply chain is targeting the problem of identification. The
        problems of scaling centralized solutions has led to the emergence of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These also
        rely on modern use of cryptography, used here to prove that you are in control of a given identity. A variety of
        different types of DIDs exist, serving different requirements such as a one-off usage to enterprise-security grade
        organization long-term representation. In itself a DID is trustless, meaning anyone can make and control a DID at any
        time. The value of a did comes from the credentials tied to it, typically by other organizations or the government.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the main identity problem has to do with identification of supply chain parties, whether these be persons or
        organizations, DIDs can just as well represent products, shipments, contractual agreements, or anything else needing
        identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that traceability-vocab's use of Decentralized Identifiers is limited to example uses. Traditional means of
        identification can be used, but use of DIDs is encouraged to ensure that actual control of an identity can be proven.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Technology Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This section conceptualizes the introduced emerging technology standards - Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data, and
        Decentralized Identifiers - with a real-world supply chain use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice is an critical supply chain document, essential among others to customs where it is used for
        duty determination. This document includes the description of the goods, where the goods are being shipped from and
        to, and a value of the goods, just to name a few of the data points. This document is supplied by the shipper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice document is typically exchanged via PDF, email or EDI. With the use of Verifiable Credential
        technology, we are able to digitalize the Commercial Invoice into a verifiable Commercial Invoice credential. Each
        data point on the Commercial Invoice VC is mapped to a semantic model for common definition using Linked Data
        (JSON-LD). For example, the “Consignee” field or the “Shipper” field on the Commercial Invoice are defined
        unambiguously to precise URIs. This promotes a singular, common definition of the data labels so that organizations
        have a shared understanding.
        <br />
        In addition, certain data points on the Commercial Invoice are used to identify an organization. For example,
        the “Consignee” field identifies who the receiver of the goods is, and the “Shipper” field identifies who the
        shipper of the goods is. Each “who” in our example is an organization. Using a Decentralized Identifier (DID),
        for example, the consignee organization can self-authenticate as the receiver of the goods.
        <br />
        The Shipper’s Decentralized Identifier is included as the Verifiable Credential issuer, binding the claims on the
        Commercial Invoice back to the Shipper. Cryptographic traceability of the Commercial Invoice is thus established from
        the Shipper to the Consignee; anyone to whom the Commercial Invoice is presented can verify that it originates from the
        Shipper and is targeted to the Consignee.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example portrays a specific use case with a Commercial Invoice and shows how Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data, and
        Decentralized Identifiers apply. We apply these technologies to common trade documents in hopes to further digitize
        documents and promote trust throughout the entire supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, this vocabulary may be looked at as a set of common objects
        that are shared across multiple business verticals, and vertical or
        use case specific items that apply to one or more specific commodities
        or market segments. A primary goal of this specification is to
        standardize the creation of Verifiable Credentials from standardized
        JSON-LD which is itself created from JSON Schema definitions as would
        normally be passed of REST and other APIs.  This promotes code re-use
        and establishes a pattern for the creation of JSON-LD and related
        Verifiable Credentials derived from those JSON-LD objects in a manner
        that is friendly to code and API development as well as to promote
        better interoperability between vendors who serve common or related
        markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes, and provides and example
        Verifiable Credential for each item.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository has primary contributors from four main market segments,
        and has subject matter experts from those market segments delegated
        as leads for objects related to vocabulary items for each segment.
        <br />
        These subject matter leads help identify common elements across verticals
        as well as in assessing contributions of new objects to the vocabulary.

          The traceability-vocab ensures that coherent sets of use case-specific
          schemas, blended together with corresponding resolvable @context data,
          point all the schemas' terms to their defining URIs. These URIs will
          generally point at existing, established vocabularies. Only when no
          applicable vocabularies can be found are terms defined as part of the
          traceability-vocab spec; these are considered exceptional cases.

          the most generic and widely adopted vocabulary is chosen. For example,
          a common term defined in schema.org will be chosen over a similar term
          defined in a industry-specific vocabulary. This is to ensure the
          broadest possible interoperability, within and beyond supply chain.

          <h4>Steel and Metals</h4>
          <p>
            The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of
            product and business information to successfully move materials
            from mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers
            (such as automotive and construction companies). Today this
            information exists primarily in siloed paper documents. In the
            current format it is very difficult to make data comparisons
            across a small number of parties, let alone across millions of
            shipments over time. It can also be difficult to catch forged
            documents in the absence of digital signatures and clearly defined
            organization data attributes.
          </p>

          <p>
            A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading
            partners to work from a common digital representation of trade
            information. Take the example of a mill report for a steel
            product. This document provides important information about the
            chemical make-up of steel materials, helping to ensure the desired
            specification and grade have been met. It also acts as evidence
            about the origins of steel materials. Unambiguous representation
            of mill report fields is critical for assessing appropriate
            duties, meeting customer requirements, and ultimately ensuring
            consumer safely.
          </p>

          <p>
            By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer
            questions like “How many pipes of specification XYZ did we
            purchase last year?” (i.e.,
            <a
              href="https://w3id.org/traceability#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json"
              >ChemicalProperty</a
            >). The mill report can also be linked to other trade
            documentation such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when
            those credentials are specified and defined. Regulators can also
            ask questions across a large number of mill reports to help catch
            transshipment issues, such as “How much steel product imported
            last month specified Vietnam as the country of origin?” (i.e.,
            <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).

              A new bridge in Pennsylvania is being built, but to construct it, the contractor needs steel beams, which requires their
              preferred American steel beam manufacturer to purchase steel slabs.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Mexican steel slab manufacturer has already produced these slabs, applied a decentralized identifier to each slab, and
              sent the slabs for testing. During testing, an inspector certified that the physical and chemical properties of the steel
              are up to international standards. The lab then issued a Mill Test Report VC which connects to the DIDs that the Mexican
              steel slab manufacturer has applied to their product.
            </p>
            <p>              
              With these quality checks complete, the Mexican manufacturer is ready for the American steel beam manufacturer's order.
              The Mexican manufacturer completes the sale of the steel slabs and issues a Commercial Invoice VC that references the
              Mill Test Report VC that was issued by the inspector. An American steel importer is now ready to take the steel slabs
              over the US-Mexico border, so they pre-register their intent to import into the US as a VC, which connects to the
              existing VCs and DIDs in the steel supply chain.
            </p>
            <p>              
              The American importer is ready to enlist the help of their haulage carrier, who will load the steel slabs onto a vehicle
              and issue a Bill of Lading VC. They'll work with a customs broker who organizes the increasingly long chain of
              documentation associated with the steel slabs. The haulage carrier adds an Import Declaration to this VC chain, marking
              another point along the steel's journey.
            </p>
            <p>              
              Finally, the truck reaches the border. CBP scans the product documentation on arrival and can easily confirm the origin
              and journey of our steel slabs. Satisfied that this steel is suitable for processing by the American steel beam
              manufacturer, CBP issues an Import Arrival VC. The steel is hauled to the American steel beam manufacturer, who shapes
              it into steel products that can be used to build our new bridge.

          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains
            that import goods to US-resident customers to register individual
            packages and pre-register products intended for sale to the US
            with US Customs. For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly
            heterogenous supply chains that might require much "internal
            confidentiality" (between supply chain actors), a highly sharded
            data model is required, whereby many different actors can each
            submit data points separately that get combined at time of customs
            processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e., legally
            defined and registered supply chain actors) and of products, and
            without high levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be
            quite hard to combine usefully. Linking the registration of
            individual packages together with the pre-registration of
            commercial products and actors is the key value-add of this
            system, but could also be a burdensome request on importers,
            retailers, and freight forwarders. To minimize this burden, we are
            aligning wherever possible with the ontology work of GS1 (GTINs
            and vLEIs), and with shipping and tracking semantics already
            adopted today by international logistics consortia. We distinguish
            between the VCs that are issued in relation to a specific package
            and the contextual information that needs to be queried to
            validate package information, as well as to make valuable
            assessments, inferences, and data quality remediation on Customs
            pre-entry data.

          A large and popular shoe manufacturer is ready to come out with their newest line of sneakers. First, they'll place an
          order to a company in Anshan, China, to manufacture their new product line. Then, the Chinese company manufactures the
          shoes to specification and issues a DID for each pair.
        </p>
        <p>          
          Next, once the new sneakers have been packaged, the Chinese manufacturer ships them after issuing a Commercial Invoice
          and Packing List. Both of these documents are issued using a DID created by and identifying the Chinese manufacturer in
          addition to including DIDs that represent each set of sneakers.
        </p>
        <p>                    
          Once safely packaged by the manufacturer, the ocean carrier takes the sneakers, carries out a consignment, and issues a
          Bill of Lading VC. The ocean carrier can issue this VC with their own DID, adding them to this supply chain workflow. In
          addition, the Bill of Lading can be linked to the Chinese manufacturer’s Commercial Invoice, Packing List, and the list
          of DIDs associated with each set of sneakers.
        </p>
        <p>          
          Our sneakers will find a home at a Danish vendor who specializes in Nike sneakers. They safely receive the container
          from the ocean carrier and store the precious goods in a warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>          
          The Danish sneaker vendor issues a Commercial Invoice and US Import Declaration as VCs, adding these documents to the
          existing workflow in order to pack up the sneakers and hand them off to their express freight service.
        </p>
        <p>          
          The express freight carrier takes the sneakers and issues an Air Waybill which connects the sneakers’ journey from
          creation to importation. Each pair of sneakers lands safely, ready to be shipped to the American customers who purchased
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, CBP first needs to verify the product documents at arrival and issue an Import Approval. This VC seamlessly
          connects to the running collection of VCs, which track the sneakers journey in detail and provide CBP with unprecedented
          visibility into the origin and authenticity of the sneakers. Using this new visibility, CBP is satisfied that the
          products are legitimate and clears the product for shipment to the buyer in America.
        </p>
        <p>          
          The buyer can trace back the origin of their sneakers using a digital paper trail of VCs. Using DIDs and VCs, CBP and
          American consumers gain a much deeper insight into where their products come from, which helps reduce the likelihood of
          knock-off products being passed off as the real thing.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

      <p>
        This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section outlines general internationalization considerations to
        take into account when utilizing this data model.
