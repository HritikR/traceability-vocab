description: >-
  Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) is but one layer in U.S.
  Customs and Border Protectionâ€™s (CBP) multi-layered cargo enforcement
  strategy. Through this program, CBP works with the trade community to
  strengthen international supply chains and improve United States border
  security. CTPAT is a voluntary public-private sector partnership program which
  recognizes that CBP can provide the highest level of cargo security only
  through close cooperation with the principle stakeholders of the international
  supply chain such as importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs
  brokers, and manufacturers. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act
  of 2006 provided a statutory framework for the CTPAT program and imposed
  strict program oversight requirements.
