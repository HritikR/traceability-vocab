  The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) allows importers to
  complete a certification of origin to include nine required data elements as
  well as a certification statement. These data elements do not need to follow a
  prescribed format. The USMCA also allows a certification of origin to be
  completed and signed with an electronic or digital signature.
